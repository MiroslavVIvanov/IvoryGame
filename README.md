# "Ivory" game
_(Bulgarian game "Genral")_

This is a course project for Telerik Academy iOS development course.
The application is essentially an implementation of the crap shooting game called "___Ivory___" or "_General_". 
It is a turn based game in which two or more players take turns in throwing 5 dices (three trows a turn) 
and the goal is to complete certain combinations of the dices. 
Because of the limitations that the mobile devices have (screen size etc.) the game is going to be 
implemented for only two players.

## Samples of functionality:
- the comunication between players is made by "Client-Server" architecture (remote data)
- players can setup their profile with adding custom avatar (using device camera)
- when listing available games - the top games are the ones that are closes to you (using device geolocation)
- when player wins - "victory" sound is played (media)
